## Data models
Data modeling is to organize and structure information into multiple, realted tables.

- relational and transactional database models

relational model: allows for easy querying and data manipulation in an easy, logical and intuitive way

transactional model: operational database - insurance claims within a healthcare database

- one-one（1:1）, one-many(1:M), and many-many(M:N) relationships

Using __ER diagrams__ to show relationships and links(primary key)

- primary keys and foreign keys

primary key: a column(or set of cols) whose values uniquely identify every row in a table

foreign key: one or more cols that can be used together to identify a single row in another table
